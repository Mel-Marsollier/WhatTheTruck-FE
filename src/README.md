Welcome to TruckTracker! :truck: The popular Food Truck locator application. Users will be able to view nearby foodtrucks with a simple click of a button. 

Food Trucks can also create an account and submit a business application. Once the application is approved by an administrator, the Food Truck can log-in to their account and update their current location with a press of a button.
